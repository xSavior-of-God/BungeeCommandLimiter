# Bungee Command Limiter ⏳

Prevent your server from crashing due to repeated command or message spam
</div>

## 🧐 Why?

Native BungeeCord doesn't have a command or message limiter, so if a user spams a command or a message, the server will
crash.
This plugin will prevent that from happening.

## 🙄 How does it work?

The plugin will check if a user has sent a message or command in a short time, and if so, it will kick the user.

## 😎 Feature

- Prevent users from spamming commands or messages in a short time
- Customizable kick message

## 💻 Commands

- **/cbl** - Reload the plugin
